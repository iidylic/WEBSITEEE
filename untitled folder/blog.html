      <p> i signed up for a forum recently. i was making my profile and it had so many questions about ME. i honestly don't know what to put. i don't know if i'm scared that people will judge me or i just genuinely don't know what i like. maybe spending countless hours on social media has caught up to me. i am young, but it makes me feel like i'm just a body i guess? i don't know how to explain it. today i have made some progress on my html though. i'm struggling with getting to know how to do nav bars but i'm sure i'll figure it out. i signed up for melonland, and i actually posted something. orginally i planned on just browsing the site like i usually do, but i don't know hopefully i do make some friends? i'm scared though. i don't really socialize on the internet anymore, it used to be a natural thing to me. something i did everyday, but i'm starting to lose those internet friends. they're busy with their life now, or we just haven't gotten to catching up. though i still love my internet friends i made in fifth grade. i'm excited for the new ones i'll make in the future as well!</p>
