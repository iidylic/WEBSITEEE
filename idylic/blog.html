				<p style = "color:black;font-family:sans-serif"> FIRST BLOG POST!!! But why are people like this. It's like they're so sure of this image they have of me. They think I don't know myself, or what I want to do, or what I'm capable of. They're always so quick to make their own judgements about me, which is weird ASF. I hate it and everyone in my life does this. I feel like I push a lot of people away because of this, so it's kinda an awkward position to be put in! One day I like this person and then the next second I dislike them because of something that they did. Then I'm obsessed with them it's so sososo weird. But I think that it's just a very human experience. I've also been trying to read more lately.. I started Norewegian Wood earlier in the summer, I bought a copy. It's really good I really enjoy Murakami like his writing is so fun to read. I don't know why it just is. He's a little bit odd though, jus a little bit.. </p>

				<p style = "color:black;font-family:sans-serif"> good afternoon people. it's another day. earlier i went out to get a milkshake and some stuff from home depot with my dad, and i saw this guy just working out in the street. like literally doing full on squats and shit. he was having like a training montage moment. anyways that was so random then i had to wait in the carvel line for 15 minutes for a mid ass milkshake. but i'm high right now so if i go have some right now it might taste a lil better than it did before... but i decided i would hop on and do sum updates for the website. i don't know which hosting site i'm gonna use for this. bcuz i tried neocities and a lot of stuff didn't work with the website so idk! i'll figure it out though. i started reading alice in wonderland on my phone but i still wanna finish norwegian wood. maybe i'll read the wind-up bird chronicles. i did earlier sophomore year but i stopped because everything is so tiring when i'm in school. unless i'm on break, i go to school come home and rot in my bed!! i do that in the summer too except i'm a little bit more productive. anyways i wanna work on my music portion of this website, but i have no idea how i want to format it? probably something simple. but i saw someone elses site and their music page looked so fire. i am soooo jealous, but for now i'll just do someting basic!!</p>
